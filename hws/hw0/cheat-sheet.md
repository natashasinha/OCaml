## Git Cheat Sheet

**Definitions**

*clone:* Retrieves an entire repository from a hosted location via URL. Allows for a local copy of the
repository to be stored.

*pull:* Used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and update the local repository to
match that content. Can also be a combination of the *git fetch* and *git merge* commands.

*push:* Transmits local branch commits to the remote repository branch. Allows for commits to be 
transferred from the local repository to the remote repository.

*add:* Adds a change in the working directory to the staging area. Changes are not recorded until *git commit*
is run.

*config:* Used to set git configuration values on a global or local project level. Executing this command
will modify a configuration text file. 

*commit:* Commits the staged content as a new commit snapshot. Used after the *git add* command.

*status:* Displays the state of the working directory and the staging area. Let's the user see which changes have been
staged and which have not.

*remote:* Lets the user create, view, and delete connections to other repositories. Similar to bookmarks in the 
sense that they serve as convenient names for less convenient URLs.
